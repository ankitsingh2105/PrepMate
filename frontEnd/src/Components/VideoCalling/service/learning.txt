| ---------------------------  | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **`RTCPeerConnection`**      | Main WebRTC API for P2P audio/video/data        | âœ… Yes       | Core WebRTC object                   |
| **`RTCSessionDescription`**  | Represents offer/answer SDP (session info)      | âœ… Yes       | Used to describe connection metadata |
| **`RTCIceCandidate`**        | Represents an ICE candidate (network path info) | âœ… Yes       | Helps NAT traversal between peers    |
| **`iceServers` config**      | STUN server config to help find public IP       | âœ… Yes       | Passed to `RTCPeerConnection`        |
| **`.onicecandidate`**        | Event fired when ICE candidates are discovered  | âœ… Yes       | You attach a listener to it          |
| **`createOffer()`**          | Generates an SDP offer to start the connection  | âœ… Yes       | Async method of `RTCPeerConnection`  |
| **`createAnswer()`**         | Generates SDP answer in response to offer       | âœ… Yes       | Used on receiving side               |
| **`setLocalDescription()`**  | Sets this peerâ€™s own session info               | âœ… Yes       | Required for signaling               |
| **`setRemoteDescription()`** | Sets remote peerâ€™s session info                 | âœ… Yes       | Required for signaling               |
| **`addIceCandidate()`**      | Adds remote ICE candidates to connection        | âœ… Yes       | Called when receiving candidates     |
| **`close()`**                | Terminates the current WebRTC connection        | âœ… Yes       | Cleanly tears down peer              |


Establishes a WebRTC peer connection using public STUN servers.

Handles ICE candidates discovery.

Provides methods to:

Generate an offer.

Create an answer from an offer.

Set remote descriptions.

Add ICE candidates received from a signaling server.

Can reset the connection (close and create a new one).


| Step | Who    | What Happens                                          |
| ---- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | User A | Joins â†’ sends "ready" to server                       |
| 2    | Server | Matches User A with User B                            |
| 3    | User A | Calls `getOffer()` â†’ sends offer via WebSocket        |
| 4    | User B | Calls `getAnswer(offer)` â†’ sends answer via WebSocket |
| 5    | Both   | Exchange ICE candidates using `addIceCandidate()`     |
| 6    | Both   | WebRTC establishes P2P connection                     |
