# WebRTC Troubleshooting Guide

## Issues Fixed

I've identified and fixed several critical issues in your WebRTC implementation:

### 1. **Peer Service Issues** âœ… Fixed
- **Problem**: Tracks were not being properly added to the peer connection
- **Solution**: Implemented proper track management with `addLocalTracks()` method
- **Problem**: ICE candidates were being handled incorrectly
- **Solution**: Added proper ICE candidate queuing and flushing

### 2. **Stream Handling Issues** âœ… Fixed
- **Problem**: Streams were not being properly initialized and managed
- **Solution**: Improved stream initialization with better constraints and error handling
- **Problem**: Tracks were being added multiple times
- **Solution**: Added proper track state management

### 3. **Connection State Management** âœ… Fixed
- **Problem**: Missing proper connection state handling
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive connection state monitoring
- **Problem**: No error recovery mechanism
- **Solution**: Added retry logic and connection reset functionality

### 4. **Backend Signaling Issues** âœ… Fixed
- **Problem**: Missing validation in WebRTC signaling
- **Solution**: Added proper validation for all WebRTC events
- **Problem**: Room management was not robust
- **Solution**: Improved room state tracking and cleanup

## How to Test

### 1. **Start Your Backend**
```bash
cd BackEnd
npm start
```

### 2. **Start Your Frontend**
```bash
cd frontEnd
npm run dev
```

### 3. **Test WebRTC Connection**
1. Open your video calling component in two different browser tabs/windows
2. Make sure both users are logged in
3. Navigate to the same room URL
4. Check the browser console for detailed logs

### 4. **Use the Test HTML File**
I've created `test-webrtc.html` for independent WebRTC testing:
1. Open `test-webrtc.html` in your browser
2. Click "Start Local Stream" to test camera/microphone access
3. Use the buttons to test different WebRTC operations

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Failed to access camera/microphone"
**Solution**: 
- Check browser permissions
- Make sure you're using HTTPS (required for getUserMedia)
- Try refreshing the page

### Issue: "No remote stream received"
**Solution**:
- Check that both users are in the same room
- Verify socket connection is established
- Check browser console for WebRTC errors

### Issue: "Connection failed"
**Solution**:
- Check your STUN/TURN server configuration
- Verify firewall settings
- Try the retry connection button

### Issue: "Room is full"
**Solution**:
- Make sure only 2 users are in the room
- Check that users are properly leaving rooms
- Restart the backend server

## Debugging Steps

### 1. **Check Browser Console**
Look for these log messages:
- âœ… Stream initialized successfully
- ðŸ”Œ Socket connected to interview namespace
- ðŸš€ Joining room
- ðŸ‘¥ New user joined
- ðŸ“ž Initiating call
- ðŸ“¹ Track received

### 2. **Check Backend Logs**
Look for these server messages:
- ðŸ”Œ Socket connected to interview namespace
- âœ… User joined room
- ðŸ“ž Call from user to user
- ðŸ§Š ICE candidate from user to user

### 3. **Check Network Tab**
- Verify WebSocket connection is established
- Check for failed HTTP requests
- Look for WebRTC-related errors

### 4. **Test with Different Browsers**
- Chrome/Edge: Best WebRTC support
- Firefox: Good support
- Safari: Limited support

## Configuration

### STUN/TURN Servers
Your current configuration uses:
- Google STUN servers (free, reliable)
- OpenRelay TURN server (free, may have limitations)

For production, consider:
- Twilio TURN servers (paid, reliable)
- Your own TURN server
- Multiple TURN server fallbacks

### ICE Configuration
```javascript
iceServers: [
    { urls: 'stun:stun.l.google.com:19302' },
    { urls: 'stun:stun1.l.google.com:19302' },
    {
        urls: 'turn:your-turn-server.com:3478',
        username: 'username',
        credential: 'password'
    }
]
```

## Performance Tips

### 1. **Video Constraints**
```javascript
video: {
    width: { ideal: 1280, min: 640 },
    height: { ideal: 720, min: 480 },
    frameRate: { ideal: 30, min: 15 }
}
```

### 2. **Audio Constraints**
```javascript
audio: {
    echoCancellation: true,
    noiseSuppression: true,
    autoGainControl: true
}
```

### 3. **Connection Monitoring**
- Monitor connection state changes
- Implement automatic reconnection
- Add connection quality indicators

## Still Having Issues?

If you're still experiencing problems:

1. **Check the test HTML file** - This will help isolate if the issue is with WebRTC or your React component
2. **Compare browser console logs** between working and non-working scenarios
3. **Test with different network conditions** (WiFi vs mobile data)
4. **Check if your firewall/network blocks WebRTC traffic**
5. **Verify that both users have camera/microphone permissions**
